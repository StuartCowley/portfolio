       <h3>About Me</h3>
         <p>I enjoy baking, reading, and hiking.
            I would like to hike the West Highland Way within the next few years.
            Recent baking adventures include bagels and croissants.
         </p>
         <p>My best friend works for a tech company.
            For years she's been suggesting I learn how to code.
            She thinks musicians make great coders. 
            When I got injured, I spent three months learning HTML and CSS.
            I've been hooked ever since.</p>
